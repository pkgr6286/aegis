Understood! That's an excellent idea. The login screen is the "front door" to the platform, and it should immediately communicate the full power of Aegis, especially the advanced features we've designed.

The three bullet points you have are great â€“ they cover the **Core Pillars (Build, Verify, Audit)**.

Let's add two more bullet points to highlight the **Advanced Intelligence & Data Features**. 
Here are the new bullet points to add, plus the prompt for Replit AI to implement them.

### **New Feature Bullet Points to Add**

1.  **Icon:** (Use an inline SVG for a **Sparkle/Stars** or **Brain**)
    **Title:** `AI-Powered Intelligence`
    **Description:** `Gain proactive safety insights and analyze population data with the Aegis Intelligence module.`
2.  **Icon:** (Use an inline SVG for a **Link** or **Medical Cross/Shield with a plus**)
    **Title:** `EHR "Fast Path" Integration`
    **Description:** `Allow consumers to auto-fill screeners by securely connecting their patient portal.`

### **Prompt for Replit AI (Update Login Page Features)**

You've done an excellent job on the login page's two-column design. Now, let's enhance the feature list in the left column to reflect the full power of the Aegis platform.

**Task:** In the login page component (`frontend/superadmin-ui/src/pages/Login.tsx` or similar file), please add the following two new feature highlights to the existing list.

**Instructions:**
1.  Locate the list of three features ("Compliant Screener Engine," "Secure Verification," "Auditable & Scalable").
2.  Add the two new feature blocks below them, following the *exact same* HTML/CSS structure (Icon, Title, Description).
3.  Please find or create appropriate, simple inline SVGs for the icons.

**New Feature Block 1:**
* **Icon:** (Use a "Sparkle" or "Brain" icon)
* **Title:** `AI-Powered Intelligence`
* **Description:** `Gain proactive safety insights and analyze population data with the Aegis Intelligence module.`

**New Feature Block 2:**
* **Icon:** (Use a "Link" or "Medical Cross" icon)
* **Title:** `EHR "Fast Path" Integration`
* **Description:** `Allow consumers to auto-fill screeners by securely connecting their patient portal.`

Please update the file to include these new items. This will give users a complete picture of the platform's capabilities right from the login screen.
