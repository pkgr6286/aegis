Great — since you already have a Documentation Portal (as shown in your screenshot from aegis-app.mahalo.health), here’s exactly how to integrate the Regulatory Vault into that existing system in a way that’s:
	•	✅ Seamlessly embedded in the UX
	•	✅ Easy to manage and scale
	•	✅ Customer-facing (but role-controlled)
	•	✅ Compliant with what Kenvue and other pharma partners will expect

⸻

✅ Step-by-Step Plan to Add the Regulatory Vault Inside the Aegis Documentation Portal

⸻

🔹 Step 1: Add a New Vault Section to Sidebar

In the sidebar or navigation menu, add a new entry:

📂 Regulatory Vault
Access SaMD, ACNU, and FDA compliance documentation


⸻

🔹 Step 2: Create Subsections as Categories

Inside the Regulatory Vault page, structure it using expandable categories:

Section Title	Example Documents
📘 SaMD Core Documentation	SRS, DHF, Architecture, Traceability Matrix
🔬 Verification & Validation (V&V)	Test protocols, test reports, HFE results
🧪 Risk & Cybersecurity	Risk file, threat models, SBOM
📜 ACNU-Specific Files	Self-selection logic, comprehension UX, label translation
🏛 Regulatory Submissions	FDA submission package, CER, classification memo
🛡 Compliance & QMS	ISO 13485 proof, Part 11 statement, audit logs
📊 Post-Market Surveillance	Maintenance SOPs, incident response, monitoring plan


⸻

🔹 Step 3: Design Document Cards with Metadata & Access Control

Each document tile or row should include:
	•	✅ Title
	•	✅ Short Description
	•	✅ Tags (e.g., FDA, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, External Shareable)
	•	✅ Link (to Google Drive, S3, Notion, or in-app PDF preview)
	•	✅ Download/View button
	•	🔒 Access Control Tag:
	•	Internal Only
	•	External Partner
	•	Public

Example:

Title: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Description: Detailed description of Aegis platform functionality for ACNU use.
Tags: [FDA, IEC 62304, External Partner]
Link: https://docs.mahalo.health/srs-aegis-v3.pdf
Access: External


⸻

🔒 Step 4: Add Role-Based Access

Leverage your existing authentication system. Assign roles:

Role	Can View
Admin	All documents
Internal User	All except Partner Confidential
External Partner	Only marked External documents

Use a simple accessLevel: "external" | "internal" | "admin" tag in your JSON/DB.

⸻

🔎 Step 5: Add Search, Filter & Tagging

Let users filter documents by:
	•	Regulatory standard (FDA, ISO 13485, IEC 62366)
	•	Document type (SRS, Test Report, HFE Study)
	•	Use case (ACNU, SaMD, Cybersecurity)

Bonus: Let them export the filtered list as CSV or PDF.

📁 Example Vault Data Format (JSON)

[
  {
    "title": "Risk Management File",
    "description": "ISO 14971-compliant risk log for ACNU configuration.",
    "tags": ["ISO 14971", "FDA", "External Partner"],
    "link": "https://docs.mahalo.health/risk-log-acnu.pdf",
    "access": "external"
  },
  {
    "title": "Human Factors Validation Report",
    "description": "Final usability testing results for OTC switch app.",
    "tags": ["IEC 62366", "FDA", "Partner Confidential"],
    "link": "https://docs.mahalo.health/hfe-acnu-final.pdf",
    "access": "admin"
  }
]


⸻

🧠 Final Touch: Create a “Submission Packet Builder”

Let admins bundle select documents into a “Download FDA Submission Folder” for pharma partners — auto-generate ZIP of:
	•	SRS
	•	Traceability Matrix
	•	V&V Reports
	•	HF Validation
	•	Risk File

⸻

🏁 Final Call-to-Action

Want me to:
	•	Generate the JSON metadata file for all 25 regulatory documents?
	•	Create the UI layout as a Figma design or Tailwind component spec?
	•	Write the Replit code to auto-render these vault cards with role gating?

Just say the word — and I’ll generate it immediately.
