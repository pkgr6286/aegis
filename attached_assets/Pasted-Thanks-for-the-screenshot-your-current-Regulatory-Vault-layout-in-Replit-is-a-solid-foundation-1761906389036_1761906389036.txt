Thanks for the screenshot — your current **Regulatory Vault layout in Replit** is a solid foundation, but it's **missing mapped documents and possibly a few category clarifications**.

Let’s do a **full audit** and give you a **Replit prompt + full document list per category**, so your customers (like Kenvue, Haleon, etc.) feel confident in Mahalo’s **regulatory maturity and SaMD readiness**.

## 🛠️ REPLIT PROMPT — Populate the Vault with All Docs

````markdown
You are building a Regulatory Vault inside the Aegis Documentation Portal. This vault will be accessed by internal teams and external partners (e.g., pharma regulatory reviewers), and should reflect Mahalo's full compliance and validation maturity.

Please do the following:

1. Ensure the following 7 categories exist (already visible):
   - SaMD Core Documentation
   - Verification & Validation
   - Risk & Cybersecurity
   - ACNU-Specific Files
   - Regulatory Submissions
   - Compliance & QMS
   - Post-Market Surveillance

2. In each category, upload document entries with:
   - Clean, professional title (see document list below)
   - Short description of purpose (for hover/click preview)
   - Tags (e.g., [FDA], [IEC 62304], [ISO 14971], [Partner-shareable])
   - Link to Google Drive, S3, or PDF preview URL
   - Access Level: admin | internal | external

3. Add filters for:
   - Tags
   - Category
   - Access Level

4. Set default view to show “external” access-level documents to external users.

5. Use this structured data format for each document:
```json
{
  "title": "Mahalo Aegis – Software Requirements Specification (SRS)",
  "category": "SaMD Core Documentation",
  "description": "Detailed spec covering platform capabilities and behavior for SaMD classification.",
  "tags": ["IEC 62304", "FDA", "Partner-shareable"],
  "access": "external",
  "link": "https://docs.mahalo.health/srs-aegis-v3.pdf"
}
````

6. Populate all 25 documents from the following categories:
   (Insert full document list per category from above.)

7. Make sure to preview formatting on both desktop and mobile (as partners may access from both).

Optional (future):

* Add export-to-zip feature for pre-bundled submission folders.
* Add badge view (✅ ISO 13485 certified, ✅ FDA-ready, etc.)

```
