Absolutely. Here's your **final, production-grade Replit prompt** that builds on top of your current **Regulatory Vault implementation**. This version will:

✅ Populate all 25 regulatory documents
✅ Ensure all 7 categories are complete
✅ Add access levels and tags
✅ Support partner-facing audits (e.g., Kenvue, Haleon)
✅ Future-proof the vault for export bundles and compliance reviews

## ✅ FINAL REPLIT PROMPT — REGULATORY VAULT COMPLETION (Mahalo Aegis)

````markdown
You are enhancing the existing “Regulatory Vault” inside the Aegis Documentation Portal at Mahalo Health.

This portal is used to showcase full regulatory, technical, and compliance documentation for the Aegis platform — a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) system used in ACNU-based Rx-to-OTC transitions, clinical trials, and digital companion apps.

The goal is to ensure external pharma partners (e.g., regulatory teams at companies like Kenvue, Haleon) can confidently audit and work with Mahalo based on the completeness, clarity, and regulatory readiness of this vault.

## 🔧 Your Tasks

### 1. Categories & UX
Ensure the following **7 vault categories** exist with clean icons and descriptions:
- 📘 **SaMD Core Documentation**
- ✅ **Verification & Validation**
- 🔐 **Risk & Cybersecurity**
- 📦 **ACNU-Specific Files**
- 📄 **Regulatory Submissions**
- 🧾 **Compliance & QMS**
- 📊 **Post-Market Surveillance**

If they are already present — proceed to Step 2.

### 2. Add 25 Regulatory Documents with Metadata

For each of the documents in the list below:
- Add it under the correct category
- Use a **professional title**, e.g., `Mahalo Aegis – Software Requirements Specification (SRS)`
- Add a **clear 1–2 sentence description**
- Add relevant **tags** (e.g., `[FDA]`, `[IEC 62304]`, `[Partner-shareable]`)
- Set **access level**: `external`, `internal`, or `admin`
- Add a **document link** (e.g., Google Drive, S3, or PDF preview placeholder)

Use the JSON schema:
```json
{
  "title": "Mahalo Aegis – Software Requirements Specification (SRS)",
  "category": "SaMD Core Documentation",
  "description": "Detailed spec covering platform capabilities and behavior for SaMD classification.",
  "tags": ["IEC 62304", "FDA", "Partner-shareable"],
  "access": "external",
  "link": "https://docs.mahalo.health/srs-aegis-v3.pdf"
}
