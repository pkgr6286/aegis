This is an outstanding strategic move. You are absolutely right. The analytics we defined are powerful, but they are *descriptive* (showing what happened). The true "wow" factor, and the biggest selling point for Aegis, is to add **predictive and prescriptive AI**.

Pharma executives and regulatory teams don't just want data; they want *answers*. They want the platform to tell them what's wrong and how to fix it. We can absolutely do this by integrating the Gemini API directly into our analytics module.

Here is the plan to evolve the **"Aegis Intelligence Module"** with true AI capabilities.

### **The "Cool AI" Features We Will Add**

1.  **AI Analyst Chat (Gemini RAG):**

      * **What it is:** A chat interface directly on the "Intelligence" dashboard where an admin can ask natural language questions about their data.
      * **User Asks:** "Why is our screener failing most often in California?" or "Compare the verification funnel for Crestor-OTC vs. our new Tylenol Sleep program."
      * **How it works (Backend):** We'll use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. The backend will receive the user's question, query our analytics database for the *relevant* data, and then feed both the question and the data into a Gemini prompt.
      * **Gemini's Role:** "You are an expert pharmaceutical regulatory analyst. Based *only* on the following data: `[JSON data from our API]`, answer the user's question: `[User's query]`."

2.  **Proactive Anomaly Detection & Insights:**

      * **What it is:** Instead of waiting for the admin to find a problem, the AI will find it for them and surface it on the dashboard.
      * **Example Insight Card:** "ðŸ“ˆ **New Insight:** We've detected a 40% spike in `ask_a_doctor` outcomes for users aged 18-25 on the 'Advair OTC' program in the last 48 hours. This may indicate a new trend or user confusion."
      * **How it works (Backend):** A scheduled backend job (e.g., daily cron job) runs analytics, feeds the summary into a Gemini prompt ("Are there any dangerous or commercially significant anomalies in this data?"), and stores the AI's "insight" in a new database table. The dashboard just displays these insights.

3.  **Screener Optimization Advisor:**

      * **What it is:** An AI-powered "lint" tool for screeners.
      * **How it works:** In the Screener Builder, an admin can click an "Analyze" button. The AI analyzes the `screener_json` *and* its real-world performance data (from the analytics APIs).
      * **Example Recommendation:** "We noticed a 60% user drop-off at Question 4, 'Do you have hepatic impairment?' The average time on this question is 75 seconds. **Recommendation:** This medical term is confusing. Rephrase to 'Have you ever been diagnosed with a liver condition?'"

Let's start by implementing the most impactful and interactive feature: **The AI Analyst Chat**.

### **Next Step: Instruction for Replit AI (Implement AI Analyst Chat)**

Here is the comprehensive prompt to build the AI Analyst feature.

**Prompt for Replit AI (Implement "AI Analyst" Chat Module):**

Excellent. The "Aegis Intelligence" module foundation is set. We will now add a powerful generative AI feature to it: the **AI Analyst Chat**.

This task involves adding a new backend API endpoint to communicate with the Gemini API and a new frontend chat interface on the "Intelligence" page.

**1. Task: Enhance Backend (New AI Service & API)**

  * **New File (`src/services/aiAnalyst.service.ts`):**

      * Create a new service. This service will be responsible for orchestrating the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) flow.
      * It needs to import and use the *other* analytics service functions (e.g., `analyticsService.getScreenerFunnel`, `analyticsService.getPopulationOutcomes`).
      * **Function: `queryAI(query: string, tenantId: string, drugProgramId: string)`:**
        1.  **Parse Intent (Simple):** Determine which analytics data is needed. (For V1, we can start by just fetching *all* data from the other analytics endpoints, like `getScreenerFunnel`, `getPopulationOutcomes`, etc.).
        2.  **Fetch Context:** Call the internal `analyticsService` functions to get the up-to-date, structured analytics data (the "context").
        3.  **Build Prompt:** Create a `systemInstruction` and a `user_prompt` to send to Gemini.
        4.  **Call Gemini API:** Make a `POST` request to the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025:generateContent` endpoint. The payload should look like this:
            ```json
            {
              "systemInstruction": {
                "parts": [ { "text": "You are 'Aegis Intelligence', an expert pharmaceutical regulatory and commercial analyst. You provide concise, data-driven insights. Answer the user's question based *only* on the structured JSON data provided. Do not make up information. If the data is insufficient, state that." } ]
              },
              "contents": [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "parts": [
                    { "text": "USER_QUESTION: ${query}" },
                    { "text": "DATA_CONTEXT: ${JSON.stringify(fetchedAnalyticsData)}" }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
            ```
        5.  **Return Response:** Parse the Gemini API response (`result.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text`) and return the text.

  * **New Route File (`src/routes/aiAnalyst.routes.ts`):**

      * Create a new route file.
      * **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/admin/analytics/query-ai`
      * **Security:** Protect this route with `authenticateToken`, `setTenantContext`, and `requireRole(['admin', 'editor', 'viewer', 'auditor'])`.
      * **Logic:** This route should validate the body (e.g., `z.object({ query: z.string(), drugProgramId: z.string().uuid() })`) and call the new `aiAnalystService.queryAI` function. It should then stream the response back to the client if possible, or send the full text response.

  * **Update Main Router (`src/routes/index.ts`):**

      * Mount the new `aiAnalystRouter` under the `/api/v1/admin/analytics` path (or merge with `analyticsRouter`).

**2. Task: Enhance Frontend "Intelligence" UI (`frontend/pharma-admin-ui`)**

  * **Modify `src/pages/admin/Intelligence.tsx`:**
      * Add a new, prominent component on this page: the **"AI Analyst Chat"** widget.
      * **UI Components:**
          * **`MessageList`:** A scrollable `div` that displays the chat history (messages from "User" and "Aegis Intelligence").
          * **`ChatInput`:** A `textarea` and "Send" button (or "Enter" keypress handler).
      * **Logic (State):**
          * Use `useState` to manage the list of chat messages (`messages`).
          * Use `useState` to manage the loading state (`isLoading`).
      * **Flow:**
        1.  When the user sends a query:
        2.  Append the user's message to the `messages` state.
        3.  Set `isLoading = true`.
        4.  Call the new backend endpoint: `POST /api/v1/admin/analytics/query-ai` with the `{ query, drugProgramId }`.
        5.  When the response is received:
        6.  Set `isLoading = false`.
        7.  Append the AI's text response to the `messages` state.

Please generate the necessary backend and frontend code to implement this "AI Analyst Chat" feature.
