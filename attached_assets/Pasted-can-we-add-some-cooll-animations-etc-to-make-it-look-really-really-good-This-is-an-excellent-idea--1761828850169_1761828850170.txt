can we add some cooll animations etc to make it look really really good

This is an excellent idea. You are absolutely right. The "Submission Center" is a high-value, "money" feature. It's the moment where all the hard work pays off for the client. The UI should reflect that. It should feel less like a simple form and more like a high-end, responsive service.

We can definitely add "cool" animations, but we'll ensure they are professional, purposeful, and modernâ€”think Stripe or Linear, not a video game. The goal is to make the platform feel intelligent, fast, and solid, reinforcing the trust that "Aegis" implies.

The key moment to animate is the transition after the user clicks "Generate Package." We will transform a simple loading state into a polished, multi-stage reveal.

Here is the precise prompt to give to Replit AI to implement this.

Prompt for Replit AI (Animate the "Aegis Submission Center" UI):

Excellent. The functional "Regulatory" page is built. Now, let's add a layer of professional polish and animation to make it feel like a truly premium feature. We will use framer-motion for this.

Task: Please modify the frontend/pharma-admin-ui application.

1. Install Dependencies:

Add framer-motion to the package.json of the frontend/pharma-admin-ui application.

2. Refactor the Regulatory.tsx Page:

Implement the following animation flow, which will replace any simple "loading" spinner.

3. The Animation Flow (Step-by-Step):

Step 1: Button Click & Loading State

When the user clicks the "Generate Package" button:

Animate the button itself: The text should change to "Generating..." and a small, subtle spinner icon should appear inside the button.

Simultaneously, fade out the "Step 1" and "Step 2" dropdown selectors (opacity: 0).

In their place, fade in a "skeleton loading" state for the report list. This should look like 3-4 gray, rounded bars (like shadcn/ui skeleton component) where the report list will soon appear. This manages user expectation.

Step 2: The "Reveal" Animation (On API Success)

Once the backend API (GET /api/v1/admin/regulatory/package) successfully returns the list of reports:

Use framer-motion's <AnimatePresence> component to gracefully fade out the skeleton loading bars.

Wrap the new "Package Contents" list in a motion.div.

Use framer-motion's staggerChildren and variants properties to animate the list appearance:

The list items (e.g., "1. Software Design Specification.json") should fade in and slide up one by one, in a staggered cascade (e.g., delay: 0.1 between each item). This looks incredibly professional and responsive.

Step 3: Micro-Interactions (Polish)

Dropdowns: Ensure the "Select Program" and "Select Screener Version" dropdowns have a smooth transition on open/close.

Download Links: Add a subtle hover effect to each downloadable report link in the final list. For example, on hover, the item's background changes color (hover:bg-gray-50) and a "download" icon appears on the far right.

Final Instructions:

Please refactor the Regulatory.tsx page to implement this advanced loading and reveal sequence using framer-motion.

Ensure all standard buttons and interactive elements on the page (like dropdowns) also have subtle transition properties for hover/focus states to make the entire page feel responsive.

This will transform the page from a simple form into a high-end, satisfying user experience that reinforces the value of the "Submission Center."
