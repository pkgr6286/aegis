# Security Notes for Aegis Platform Backend

## Security Status Overview

### JWT Authentication - IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ

**Status**: üü¢ SECURE (Development mode with fallback)

The authentication middleware (`server/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`) now implements **proper JWT signature verification** using the `jsonwebtoken` library.

#### Current Implementation

1. ‚úÖ **Signature Verification**: JWT tokens are cryptographically verified using `jwt.verify()`
2. ‚úÖ **Forged Token Protection**: Tokens with invalid signatures are rejected
3. ‚úÖ **Expiration Handling**: Expired tokens are properly rejected
4. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Different JWT errors (invalid, expired, malformed) are handled separately

#### Required Actions Before Production

1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: jsonwebtoken library installed
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: JWT verification implemented with signature checking
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTION REQUIRED**: Set a strong JWT_SECRET in production:
   ```bash
   # Generate a strong secret:
   openssl rand -base64 32

   # Add to production .env:
   JWT_SECRET="your-generated-secret-here"
   ```

4. üìã **TODO**: Implement token generation in authentication service:
   ```typescript
   import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
   
   const token = jwt.sign(
     {
       userId: user.id,
       email: user.email,
       systemRoles: userSystemRoles,
       tenantId: tenantId,
     },
     process.env.JWT_SECRET,
     { expiresIn: '7d' }
   );
   ```

5. üìã **TODO**: Add automated security tests:
   - Test that forged tokens are rejected
   - Test that expired tokens are rejected
   - Test that tokens with invalid signatures are rejected
   - Test that legitimate tokens populate roles correctly

#### Development Mode

In development, if `JWT_SECRET` is not set, the system automatically uses a fallback secret: `development-secret-DO-NOT-USE-IN-PRODUCTION`. This is **ONLY** for local development convenience.

**Production Deployment**: The application will refuse to start if `JWT_SECRET` is not set when `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Multi-Tenant Security (RLS)

### Row-Level Security Setup

The platform uses PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS) to enforce tenant data isolation.

#### Status: ‚úÖ RLS Policies Created

All RLS policies have been created using `server/migrations/001_enable_rls_policies.sql`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL LIMITATION - Neon Database Architecture

**RLS policies do NOT work with database owner accounts!**

In Neon databases, the default user (`neondb_owner`) is a member of `pg_database_owner` role, which **bypasses all RLS policies** even with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`.

#### Required for Production

To enforce RLS in production, you MUST:

1. **Create an application role** without owner privileges:
```sql
CREATE ROLE app_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure-password-here';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE neondb TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;
```

2. **Update DATABASE_URL** to use the application role:
```
# Development/Migrations (bypasses RLS):
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:password@host/neondb

# Production Application (enforces RLS):
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://app_user:password@host/neondb
```

3. **Reserve owner account** for migrations and admin tasks only

See `server/migrations/001_enable_rls_policies.sql` for complete setup instructions and test procedures.

#### Tenant Context Validation

The `setTenantContext()` function validates tenant IDs using a UUID regex before executing the SET command:

```typescript
const uuidRegex = /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i;
```

This prevents SQL injection even without parameterization, but additional safety is provided by Drizzle's SQL template tags.

## Additional Security Considerations

### Password Hashing

Currently, no password hashing is implemented. Before production:

1. Install bcrypt or argon2
2. Hash all passwords before storage
3. Never store plaintext passwords

### API Keys

Partner API keys in the `partner_api_keys` table:

1. Must be hashed before storage (use bcrypt with high work factor)
2. Should have expiration dates
3. Should support rotation
4. Should be revocable

### Audit Logging

Audit logs are critical for compliance:

1. Never delete audit logs (they are insert-only)
2. Audit log failures are logged but don't block operations
3. Include before/after states in changes field
4. Store enough context to reconstruct actions

## Development vs Production

This codebase is currently in **DEVELOPMENT MODE** with the following status:

- ‚úÖ JWT signature verification implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è JWT_SECRET uses development fallback if not set
- ‚ùå No password hashing (no password auth yet)
- ‚ùå No rate limiting
- ‚ùå No API key hashing
- ‚ùå No HTTPS enforcement
- ‚ùå RLS policies not created in database

**PRODUCTION CHECKLIST**: See security checklist below before deploying.

## Security Checklist for Production

- [x] Install and configure jsonwebtoken
- [x] Implement JWT signature verification
- [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET in production environment (currently uses dev fallback)
- [ ] Install and configure bcrypt/argon2 (when password auth is implemented)
- [ ] Hash all user passwords (when password auth is implemented)
- [ ] Hash all API keys (when partner API keys are implemented)
- [x] Create all RLS policies on database
- [ ] Create application role for RLS enforcement (see Multi-Tenant Security section)
- [ ] Update production DATABASE_URL to use app_user role
- [ ] Test RLS policies with app_user role and different tenant contexts
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Add request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated security testing
- [ ] Perform security audit
- [ ] Set up automated dependency scanning
